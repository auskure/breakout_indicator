# [Breakout Signal Analysis Tool] - A Jupyter Notebook and Python Script Example

## Description:

This repository provides both an interactive Jupyter Notebook and a standalone Python script to demonstrate a simple breakout signal analysis tool.

## Requirements:

To install requirements, run the following.

'cd breakout_signal'
'pip install -r requirements.txt'

## Jupyter Notebook:

For a detailed, step-by-step exploration of the analysis process, you can view the Jupyter Notebook: BreakoutWithBackTest.ipynb

This approach allows you to experiment with code cells, visualize data, and gain a deeper understanding of the workflow.

## Python Script:

If you prefer a streamlined, executable version, head over to the python_script_version folder: /python_script_version

Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
'python main.py'

Use code with caution.

This will execute the code directly, providing the results without the interactive environment of a notebook.

A successful run will have the following output:
'Price change graph successfully saved in ./results/priceComparison.png'
'Completed successfully! Check ./results/calculation.txt'

## Credits
This code was adapted from the breakout analysis algorithm of [CodeTradingCafe](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeTradingCafe). It has been refactored, and a better strategy has been added, which increases the overall return on investment.  I am open to more suggestions of different features to be added.
